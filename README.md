## What is Git?
Git is a popular free and open source version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

It is used for:

- Tracking code changes
- Tracking who made changes
- Coding collaboration
